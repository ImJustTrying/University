This is my text adventure game. The game follows an unnamed protagonist maneuvering a set of rooms.
The rooms are all adjacent to one another, and they contain various items (e.g. maps, notes, etc).
The goal is to essentially solve an 8-puzzle by moving the rooms (the rooms are numbered by the
buttons they contain) with a controller. The controller will move an activated room as long as the
player is not in it. The player activates a room by pressing the numbered button inside it.
As of the time of submission, I am not able to complete the game because
taking 3 exams in the same week is supposedly an effective method for getting students to retain
content from their courses. It may run, but there are many logical errors and much of the
functionality is not implemented (or implemented incorrectly), so do not expect reasonable output.
